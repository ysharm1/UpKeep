# Decision Framework: Which Customer First?

## The Critical Question

**How many property managers do you personally know or can reach within 30 days?**

Write the number: _______

---

## If Your Answer Is 0-2

### Reality Check
You don't have a warm path to property managers. You'll need to:
- Cold outreach (email + LinkedIn)
- Attend local PM networking events
- Offer aggressive incentives (free pilot)
- Do sales calls (not just coding)

### Time Investment
- 10-15 hours/week on outreach
- 2-4 weeks to close first PM
- 4-8 weeks to get 10 PMs

### Recommendation
**Consider homeowner-first strategy.**

**Why:**
- Faster to get first customers
- No sales cycle
- Can launch and iterate quickly

**But accept:**
- Random volume
- Low repeat rate
- Price sensitivity
- Harder to build liquidity

### Alternative
**Pivot to pure SaaS for property managers.**
- Build property management software
- Charge monthly fee
- No marketplace complexity
- Easier to sell

## If Your Answer Is 3-10

### Reality Check
You have a warm path but need to execute. You'll need to:
- Personal outreach to your network
- Ask for intros to other PMs
- Offer white-glove onboarding
- Get feedback and iterate

### Time Investment
- 5-10 hours/week on outreach
- 1-2 weeks to close first PM
- 2-4 weeks to get 5 PMs

### Recommendation
**Property manager first (recommended).**

**Why:**
- You have warm intros
- Faster to close
- Can perfect product with friendly users
- Leverage referrals

**Approach:**
1. Start with friendliest 3 PMs
2. Offer free pilot (first month)
3. Get feedback, iterate
4. Ask for referrals
5. Expand to 10 PMs
6. Open to homeowners

---

## If Your Answer Is 10+

### Reality Check
You have a strong wedge. You should:
- Start with friendliest 5 PMs
- Perfect the product
- Leverage network effects
- Expand through referrals

### Time Investment
- 3-5 hours/week on onboarding
- <1 week to close first PM
- 2-3 weeks to get 10 PMs

### Recommendation
**Property manager first (strongly recommended).**

**Why:**
- You have the network
- Fast path to liquidity
- Predictable revenue
- Defensible moat

**Approach:**
1. Personal outreach to top 5
2. White-glove onboarding
3. Get to 10 PMs in Month 1
4. Add PM features based on feedback
5. Expand to 20 PMs in Month 2
6. Open to homeowners in Month 3

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Homeowner First | Property Manager First |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Time to first customer** | 1 week | 2-4 weeks |
| **Customer acquisition cost** | Low (ads) | Medium (sales) |
| **Revenue predictability** | Low (random) | High (repeat) |
| **Operational burden** | High (one-time) | Medium (repeat) |
| **Lifetime value** | Low ($50-100) | High ($5,000-50,000) |
| **Referral potential** | Low | High |
| **Network effects** | Weak | Strong |
| **Defensibility** | Low | High |
| **Your time investment** | 3-4 hrs/day ops | 2-3 hrs/day sales + ops |

## The Honest Assessment

### Homeowner First Works If:
- ✅ You can't reach property managers
- ✅ You want to launch fast
- ✅ You're okay with random volume
- ✅ You can handle 3-4 hours/day operations
- ✅ You're okay with low repeat rate

### Property Manager First Works If:
- ✅ You can reach 10+ property managers
- ✅ You're willing to do sales
- ✅ You want predictable revenue
- ✅ You can wait 2-4 weeks for first customer
- ✅ You want to build a defensible business

## The Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

### If You Have 3+ PM Contacts:

**Week 1:** Launch core product
**Week 2:** Onboard 3-5 PMs (warm intros)
**Week 3-4:** Add PM features, get feedback
**Month 2:** Expand to 10 PMs through referrals
**Month 3:** Open to homeowners in same zip codes

**This gives you:**
- Fast launch (Week 1)
- Predictable revenue (PMs)
- Overflow volume (homeowners)
- Defensible moat (B2B relationships)

---

## What to Do Right Now

### Step 1: Count Your PM Contacts (5 minutes)
- LinkedIn connections
- Personal network
- Friends of friends
- Former colleagues
- Real estate investors you know

**Write the number: _______**

### Step 2: Assess Reachability (10 minutes)
For each PM contact, rate:
- 🟢 Warm (would take your call)
- 🟡 Lukewarm (need intro)
- 🔴 Cold (don't know you)

**How many 🟢 Warm contacts? _______**

### Step 3: Make the Decision (5 minutes)

**If 5+ warm PM contacts:**
→ **Property manager first**
→ Read GTM_STRATEGY.md
→ Start outreach this week

**If 1-4 warm PM contacts:**
→ **Hybrid approach**
→ Start with warm PMs
→ Open to homeowners in Month 2

**If 0 warm PM contacts:**
→ **Homeowner first OR pivot to SaaS**
→ Accept operational burden
→ Or build PM software without marketplace

## The Strategic Frameworks

### Uber Didn't Launch Everywhere
- Started in San Francisco
- Black cars only (premium)
- Dense city (high demand)
- Controlled supply

**Your equivalent:**
- Start in one city
- Property managers first (predictable)
- Dense area (high volume)
- Controlled provider quality

### Marketplace Liquidity Formula
```
Liquidity = Supply × Demand × Match Quality

Property Manager First:
Supply: Consistent (PMs bring repeat jobs)
Demand: Predictable (maintenance schedules)
Match Quality: High (same vendors, same areas)
= Strong Liquidity

Homeowner First:
Supply: Random (one-time jobs)
Demand: Unpredictable (when things break)
Match Quality: Variable (different needs)
= Weak Liquidity
```

## Final Recommendation

### If You Can Reach 5+ Property Managers:
**Do property manager first. It's not even close.**

**Why:**
- 4x the revenue per customer
- Predictable volume
- Easier operations
- Defensible moat
- Network effects

**Trade-off:**
- 2-4 weeks slower to launch
- Need to do sales
- Need to build PM features

**But worth it.**

### If You Can't Reach Property Managers:
**Do homeowner first, but know the risks.**

**Why:**
- Faster to launch
- No sales needed
- Can iterate quickly

**Trade-off:**
- Random volume
- Low repeat
- High operational burden
- Weak defensibility

**Or consider:**
- Pure SaaS for PMs (no marketplace)
- Different vertical entirely
- Partner with someone who has PM network

## The Question You Must Answer

**Before you write another line of code:**

> How many property managers do you personally know or can reach within 30 days?

**If 5+:** Property manager first
**If 1-4:** Hybrid approach
**If 0:** Homeowner first or pivot

**Answer this question. Then execute.**

Don't build for both. Don't split focus.

**Pick one. Go deep. Win.**
