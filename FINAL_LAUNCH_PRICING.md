# FINAL Launch Pricing - Diagnostic-First Model

## The Model (Simple & Clear)

### Standard Flow:
1. **Homeowner posts new problem**
2. **Diagnostic required** (not optional)
3. **Homeowner pays diagnostic fee:** $85 (provider sets it)
4. **You take:** 15% of diagnostic = $12.75
5. **Provider gets:** $72.25 for diagnostic visit
6. **Provider does diagnostic, gives repair quote**
7. **If repair approved:** Diagnostic fee credited toward repair
8. **Provider keeps:** 100% of repair work

### Your Revenue Per Job:
**$12.75** (15% of $85 diagnostic fee)

### Provider Cost:
**2.6%** of total revenue (diagnostic + repair)

---

## Why This Works

### ✅ Adoption Side:
- Not taxing full repair
- Providers don't feel like you're skimming their real revenue
- $12.75 per job feels reasonable
- Much lower bypass incentive
- Mirrors real contractor behavior

### ✅ Revenue Side:
- Every new job must pass through diagnostic
- You monetize every job entry
- Predictable income
- No subscription complexity yet
- Simple to explain and implement

### ✅ Psychological Unlock:
**Diagnostic fee is credited toward repair**
- Homeowner feels: "I'm not losing money"
- Provider feels: "This is normal"
- You still take your 15% of diagnostic
- No friction

## Revenue Math

### Early Stage (10 providers):
```
10 providers × 25 diagnostics/month = 250 diagnostics
250 × $12.75 = $3,187/month
Annual: ~$38K/year
```

### Growth Stage (50 providers):
```
50 providers × 25 diagnostics/month = 1,250 diagnostics
1,250 × $12.75 = $15,937/month
Annual: ~$191K/year
```

### Scale (200 providers):
```
200 providers × 25 diagnostics/month = 5,000 diagnostics
5,000 × $12.75 = $63,750/month
Annual: ~$765K/year
```

**This is a real business.**

## Provider Economics Example

### John the HVAC Guy - Month 1:

**25 diagnostic jobs:**
```
Diagnostics: 25 × $72.25 = $1,806
Repairs: 20 approved × $500 avg = $10,000
Total revenue: $11,806
Platform cost: 25 × $12.75 = $319
Effective cost: 2.7%
```

**John's reaction:** "This is way cheaper than Thumbtack!"

**Your revenue:** $319 from one provider

**Homeowner experience:** "I paid $85 diagnostic, got it credited toward my $500 repair, so I paid $415 more. Fair!"
