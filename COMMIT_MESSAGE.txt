Finalize launch strategy: PM-first with homeowner overflow

Strategic Changes:
- Add GTM strategy (property managers as primary wedge)
- Add decision framework (based on PM network access)
- Property managers = 4x revenue, predictable volume, defensible moat
- Homeowners = tap into existing liquidity (Phase 2)

Product Changes:
- Update payment flow (capture diagnostic after visit, not at completion)
- Add admin tools spec (operations dashboard + manual overrides)
- Add provider reliability tracking fields
- Enhanced admin capabilities (reassign, retry, refund)

Documentation:
- SHIP_IT.md: No BS launch plan (8 endpoints, 2 days)
- GTM_STRATEGY.md: Property manager first strategy
- DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md: Which customer first decision tree
- PRODUCT_WEAKNESSES.md: Honest assessment of 3 critical weaknesses
- OPERATIONS_PLAYBOOK.md: Week 1 manual operations guide
- EXECUTE.md: Final execution checklist

Key Principles:
- Ship core product first (works for both PMs and homeowners)
- Test with real users (don't build features before users)
- Add only what's requested (no premature optimization)
- One clean engine, multiple user types (no forking)
- Minimal branching logic (same flow for everyone)

Timeline:
- Day 1-2: Build 8 endpoints + admin tools
- Day 3-4: Deploy to production
- Week 2: Onboard first users (PM or homeowner)
- Week 3-4: Add features ONLY if requested

Ready to ship in 2 days. No scope expansion.
