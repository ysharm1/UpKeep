# Go-To-Market Strategy: Property Manager First

## The Strategic Pivot

### ❌ OLD Strategy (Risky)
Primary: Homeowners (one-time, price-sensitive, random volume)
Secondary: Property managers (maybe later)

### ✅ NEW Strategy (Smart)
**Primary: Property managers (repeat, predictable, rational)**
**Secondary: Homeowners (tap into existing liquidity)**

---

## Why Property Managers First

### Property Managers Have:
- ✅ Constant maintenance issues (repeat volume)
- ✅ Already work with vendors (understand the model)
- ✅ Care about documentation (your system provides this)
- ✅ Repeat volume (not one-time)
- ✅ Make rational decisions (not emotional)
- ✅ Refer across networks (word spreads fast)

### Homeowners Have:
- ❌ Use service once every few years (low repeat)
- ❌ Shop by price (race to bottom)
- ❌ Call who neighbor uses (no loyalty)
- ❌ Emotional urgency but low repeat (hard to predict)

### The Math
**10 property managers with 50 units each = 500 units**
- Average 2 maintenance issues/unit/year = 1,000 jobs/year
- Average job value $300 = $300,000 GMV
- 15% platform fee = $45,000 revenue

**500 homeowners:**
- Average 0.5 jobs/year = 250 jobs/year
- Average job value $300 = $75,000 GMV
- 15% platform fee = $11,250 revenue

**Property managers = 4x the revenue with 1/50th the customer acquisition.**

## What Your Product Actually Is

### ❌ NOT:
"Consumer repair marketplace"

### ✅ IS:
**"Maintenance OS for property operators"**

**That happens to be available for homeowners too.**

---

## The Hybrid Model (Phase by Phase)

### Phase 1: Property Manager Wedge (Month 1-2)
**Goal: 10-20 small property managers (5-200 units each)**

**What you build:**
- Repeat maintenance workflow
- Work order tracking
- Vendor reliability scoring
- Cost reporting by property
- Maintenance history per unit

**What you DON'T build yet:**
- Consumer marketing pages
- Dual pricing logic
- Mixed messaging

**Focus:** One city. One vertical. Deep penetration.

### Phase 2: Homeowner Overflow (Month 3+)
**Goal: Open to homeowners in same zip codes**

**What changes:**
- Add homeowner landing page
- Add "Available for homeowners too" messaging
- Same providers, same flow

**What homeowners see:**
- Real providers (already serving PMs)
- Fast response (providers are active)
- Active system (not empty marketplace)

**This is when it works.**

---

## Positioning Change

### ❌ OLD Positioning:
"Find a contractor fast"
(Generic, competitive, consumer-focused)

### ✅ NEW Positioning:
**"The professional way to manage property repairs."**
**"Available for homeowners too."**

**This subtle difference changes who you attract first.**

---

## Product Changes Required

### Good News: Very Little

Your current product already supports this. You just need to:

1. **Add property manager features (Week 2-4):**
   - Property/unit tracking
   - Cost reporting by property
   - Maintenance history
   - Bulk job creation
   - Vendor performance dashboard

2. **Adjust messaging:**
   - Landing page targets PMs
   - Homeowner page is secondary
   - Pricing emphasizes volume discounts

3. **Add PM-specific onboarding:**
   - Property import
   - Unit setup
   - Preferred vendor assignment
   - Billing setup

**Time to build: 8-12 hours (Week 2-4, after core launch)**

## Property Manager Outreach Script

### Cold Email Template

**Subject:** Better way to manage maintenance for [Property Name]

Hi [Name],

I'm building a platform that helps property managers like you handle maintenance more efficiently.

Instead of juggling phone calls, texts, and emails with multiple vendors, you get:
- One dashboard for all maintenance requests
- Verified vendors with transparent pricing
- Automatic work order tracking
- Cost reporting by property

I'm offering free pilot access to the first 10 property managers in [City].

Interested in a 15-minute demo?

[Your Name]
[Your Phone]

### Phone Call Script

**Introduction:**
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name]. I'm building a maintenance management platform specifically for property managers. Do you have 2 minutes?"

**Pain Point:**
"Right now, when you have a maintenance issue, you probably call a vendor, wait for them to call back, get a quote, approve it, then track the work. Is that about right?"

**Solution:**
"What if you could submit a request, get instant vendor matching, approve quotes in the app, and track everything in one dashboard?"

**Offer:**
"I'm offering free pilot access to the first 10 property managers. Can I show you a quick demo?"

**Close:**
"Great. When's a good time this week? I'll come to your office."

## The Trap to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Build PM dashboards AND consumer marketing pages at launch
- Try to message to both audiences equally
- Create dual pricing logic upfront
- Split your focus

### ✅ DO:
- Launch core product (Week 1)
- Add PM features (Week 2-4)
- Perfect PM experience (Month 1-2)
- Open to homeowners (Month 3+)

**Focus builds traction.**

---

## Why This Works

### The Flywheel

1. **Sign 10 property managers**
   - They have constant maintenance needs
   - Predictable job volume

2. **Providers get consistent work**
   - They stay active on platform
   - They respond quickly
   - They build reliability scores

3. **Open to homeowners in same area**
   - They see active providers
   - They get fast responses
   - They trust the system

4. **More volume attracts more providers**
   - Better provider selection
   - Faster response times
   - Better pricing

5. **Better experience attracts more PMs**
   - Referrals from happy PMs
   - Network effects kick in
   - Defensible moat

**This is how you build a marketplace that works.**

---

## The Reality Check

### This Strategy Requires:

**1. Access to Property Managers**
- Can you reach 10-20 PMs in 30 days?
- Do you have warm intros?
- Can you cold outreach effectively?

**2. Willingness to Do Sales**
- Phone calls
- In-person demos
- Relationship building
- Not just coding

**3. Patience for B2B Sales Cycle**
- 2-4 weeks to close a PM
- Longer than consumer (instant)
- But higher LTV

**4. Product Iteration**
- PMs will have specific needs
- You'll need to build PM features
- Not just instant booking

### If You Can't Do This:

**Stick with homeowner-first.**

But know the risks:
- Random volume
- Low repeat
- Price sensitivity
- Harder to build liquidity

---

## The Decision Tree

```
Can you reach 10+ property managers in 30 days?
├─ YES → Property manager first (recommended)
│   ├─ Launch core product (Week 1)
│   ├─ Onboard 5 PMs (Week 2)
│   ├─ Add PM features (Week 3-4)
│   └─ Open to homeowners (Month 3)
│
└─ NO → Homeowner first (riskier)
    ├─ Launch core product (Week 1)
    ├─ Market to homeowners (Week 2+)
    ├─ Fight for liquidity (Month 1-3)
    └─ Hope for network effects (Month 3+)
```

---

## Action Items (Right Now)

### Before You Write Another Line of Code:

1. **Answer this question:**
   > How many property managers do you personally know or can reach within 30 days?

2. **If 0-2:**
   - Research local PMs on LinkedIn
   - Find PM networking events
   - Draft cold outreach email
   - Decide if you can do sales

3. **If 3-10:**
   - List them out
   - Rank by friendliness
   - Draft personal outreach
   - Schedule calls this week

4. **If 10+:**
   - You have a wedge
   - Start with friendliest 3
   - Offer free pilot
   - Get feedback

### Then:

**If you can reach PMs:**
- ✅ Launch core product (Week 1)
- ✅ Add PM features (Week 2-4)
- ✅ Onboard PMs (Week 2+)
- ✅ Open to homeowners (Month 3)

**If you can't reach PMs:**
- ✅ Launch core product (Week 1)
- ✅ Market to homeowners (Week 2+)
- ✅ Accept the operational burden
- ✅ Fight for liquidity

---

## The Bottom Line

**Property managers = recurring B2B revenue engine**
**Homeowners = tap into existing liquidity**

If you build liquidity through PMs, homeowners become easy.
If you start with homeowners, you fight randomness forever.

**The question is: Can you reach property managers?**

Answer that, and you'll know your strategy.
